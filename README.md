# About Me üêæ

I was fortunate enough to move to this country when I was very young, and it was my dream to have the freedom to learn at my own pace. Reading articles and watching videos about React wasn't efficient for me. Practicing and writing code was the most effective way for me to learn React. I am developing Mo Skool to become an interactive tool to learn and share knowledge about React and frontend development. Best of all, I want this learning experience to be free and available for everyone to enjoy.
