# Mo Skool

My mission is to share frontend knowledge with everyone around the world. üåç

That's why I've started Mo Skool, which is a frontend learning platform, offering a new interactive and fun path to mastering frontend React development.

Although this project is still under *heavy development*, my vision for the end product is crystal clear. I see this as an excellent opportunity to add value to our world and help others enjoyably grow into frontend development.

## What Can I learn?

### Front-End
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS in JS
- React
- JSX

# Current Tech
The app has a React frontend and paired with a Firebase cloud backend


## Love to contribute ü§©
I am excited to collaborate with other frontend engineers to get this up and going. I am also enthusiastic about the opportunity to share React knowledge with new contributors.
