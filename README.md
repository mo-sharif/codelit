Mo Skool is a code learning platform featuring an all-new simple, interactive and fun way to learn and master frontend programming languages. Mo Skool's ultimate mission is to provide this learning opportunity for all ages around the world.

Students are greeted with a short survey about their current coding skills, then the app will match students with a roadmap relates to their coding skills. The roadmap is made of a series of short interactive questions, the student has the opportunity to interact with the question's code while looking at the real-time preview of the code. Students have the opportunity to learn about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, Styled-components, and other frontend topics.

# About Me üêæ

I was fortunate enough to move to the United States when I was little, and it was a dream come true when I experienced freedom for the first time. I've used this freedom wisely by dedicating my days to learn all about software engineering. My new skills have propelled me far in life. I was fortunate to relocate to San Francisco and use my skills to make a huge impact on several organizations. I believe this is the perfect time for me to share my experience and knowledge with the world and help others find success.

# Technology

Built with the future in mind, starting out as a web application but can be easily developed into a mobile app.
